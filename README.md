## About The Project

This projects uses marchine learning techniques to help estate agencies understand the housing market.
In this project uses house_data.csv dataset to statisitically analyse fromt the pointof view of classification, prediction and subsequently validation.

Here are the manjor project objectives:
1.  Provide numerical and graphical summaries of the data set and make any initial comments
that you deem appropriate.
2.  Divide houses based on their overall condition (OverallCond) as follows:
    - Poor if the overall condition is between 1 to 3.
    - Average if the overall condition is between 4 and 6.
    - Good if the overall condition is between 7 and 10
        - Fit a logistic regression model which predicts the overall condition (OverallCond) of a
house.
        - Carry out a similar study using a different classification method to
classify the house condition.

3. Predicting house prices:
    -  Employ 2 different methods in order to predict house prices. Justify the
choice of model and comment on the results obtained.
    - Use two re-sampling methods of choice to estimate the test error associated with
fitting these particular methods chosen in 3(a) on a set of observations. Comment on
the results you obtained.

4. Using this data set, house-data.csv, what else would be interesting in investigating? Identify
a ‘research question’ in relation to housing data and employ different methodology to answer this question.
